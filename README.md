# Smart Parking Space Detection System

## Project Overview
The traditional process of finding parking spaces is often time-consuming and inefficient, leading to unnecessary fuel consumption, traffic congestion, and driver frustration.  
The **Smart Parking Space Detection System** is designed to automatically detect available and occupied parking spaces and provide real-time information to drivers, making the parking process faster and more efficient.

This project proposes a smart parking solution using **computer vision (OpenCV)**, cameras, and sensor-based inputs to identify parking space availability and guide drivers to the nearest available spot through a digital interface.

---

## Problem Statement
- Drivers spend significant time searching for parking spaces
- Increased traffic congestion in parking areas
- Higher fuel consumption and pollution
- Lack of real-time parking availability information

---

## Proposed Solution
The system uses cameras and/or sensors installed in parking areas to continuously monitor parking slots.  
Captured data is processed using intelligent algorithms to determine whether a parking space is **occupied or vacant**.

Drivers receive:
- Real-time parking availability
- Visual guidance to free parking slots
- Reduced search time and congestion

---

## System Workflow
1. Cameras and sensors capture real-time parking data
2. Images/video frames are processed using OpenCV-based algorithms
3. Parking slots are classified as **occupied** or **available**
4. Availability information is updated in real time
5. Drivers are guided to the nearest free parking space via an application/interface
